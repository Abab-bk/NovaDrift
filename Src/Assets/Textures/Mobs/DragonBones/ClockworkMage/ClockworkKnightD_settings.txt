//-- ClockworkKnightD -- Animations
---------------------
Idle, IdleR, IdleWeak, IdleWeakR, Attack, Skill, Damage
NOTE: IdleR/IdleWeakR is included in-case you use this as a battler, so the clockface rotates in the clockwise direction.
You'll also need to edit the image in any editing software to mirror the clock so it's the right way for a battler too.
